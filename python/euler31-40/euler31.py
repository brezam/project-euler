Let coins be the list of all coins, the value at row col is defined by:
    table[row][col] = table[row-1][col] + table[row][col-coins[row-1]] (Eq. 1)

We want the very last value at bottom-right, which answers how to make
200p (Â£2) using all the coins. (Note that it's at row len(coins)+1, not len(coins))

We know that we can only make nothing with nothing, so the first row
is [1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (We cannot make 1 with nothing, we cannot make 2 with nothing, etc;
and there's only 1 way to make 0 with nothing.)

Using that fact and (Eq. 1) we can compute the bottom-right value.

PS: All of this was unecessary since using a simpler greedy algorithm is enough for these particular coin set.
